Mission
======
The Center's mission is to partner with relevant units of Illinois Tech community to conduct impactful research and innovation in data-driven predictive modeling and simulation for systems under uncertainty, and emerging stochastic dynamics and data science techniques inspired by science and engineering advances.

Vision
======
The Center's vision is to be recognized in Chicago, the nation, and globally for promoting data-driven research and training in stochastic dynamics.

Mission Statement
------
The center benefits Illinois Techâ€™s stochastic dynamics community in the following ways:

1. Offering minicourses on new or emerging topics in stochastic dynamics & data science, by visiting scholars, as a supplement to our exiting academic programs
1. Serving as one interdisciplinary hub to facilitate research and collaboration, especially among junior faculty and postdocs
1. Hosting visitors (especially pass by visitors) for research and seminars
1. Hosting graduate student seminars
1. Sponsoring undergraduate research (minority/women students, pre-REU, REU)
1. Organizing activities such as joint workshops, including DEI workshops with Argonne National Laboratory and the NSF Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation

The center plays a key role to partner effectively with corporate, university, national laboratory, and governmental stakeholders by driving collaborative, computational and data-driving research involving faculty and students from several disciplines, and by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Many funding opportunities call for expertise from various disciplines and the center, with people who share the same mission and vision, can put people in a team to respond to these opportunities. The center will appoint some research scientists at Argonne National Laboratory as research faculty, to facilitate collaborative research and educational activities.
